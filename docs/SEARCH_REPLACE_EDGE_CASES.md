# Search and Replace API Edge Cases

This document outlines the comprehensive edge cases covered by the search and replace API unit tests to ensure robust functionality under various conditions.

## Overview

The search and replace API has been thoroughly tested with both the existing intensive test suite (`test_search_replace_intensive.py`) and a new comprehensive edge cases test suite (`test_search_replace_edge_cases.py`).

## Test Categories

### 1. File System Edge Cases (`TestFileSystemEdgeCases`)

**Directory vs File Conflicts**
- Tests behavior when patch target is a directory instead of a file
- Ensures proper error handling for invalid file types
- Prevents accidental directory modifications

**Disk Space Limitations**
- Tests patch application with very large replacement content (10MB)
- Ensures graceful handling of potentially low disk space scenarios
- Verifies system stability under large file operations

**Invalid File Paths**
- Tests various invalid file path scenarios:
  - Path traversal attempts (`../../../etc/passwd`)
  - Windows reserved names (`con.txt`)
  - Null bytes in filenames (`file\x00.txt`)
  - Extremely long filenames (300+ characters)
  - Empty filenames
  - Current/parent directory references (`.`, `..`)
- Ensures security against path traversal attacks
- Verifies proper sandboxing within workspace boundaries

### 2. Content Edge Cases (`TestContentEdgeCases`)

**Binary Files**
- Tests patch application to binary files containing non-UTF-8 content
- Ensures graceful handling of binary data
- Verifies proper error reporting for unsupported content types

**Null Bytes in Content**
- Tests handling of null bytes (`\x00`) within file content
- Ensures proper string processing with embedded null characters
- Verifies file integrity after null byte handling

**Unicode and Encoding**
- Tests various Unicode characters:
  - Emoji characters (`üåçüöÄüíª`, `üòÄüéâ‚ú®`)
  - Chinese characters (`‰Ω†Â•Ω‰∏ñÁïå`)
  - Mathematical symbols (`‚àë‚à´‚àÇ‚àö`)
- Ensures proper UTF-8 encoding preservation
- Verifies Unicode content integrity after modifications

**Extremely Long Lines**
- Tests files with lines containing 100,000+ characters
- Ensures memory-efficient handling of very long lines
- Verifies performance doesn't degrade with extreme line lengths

**Empty and Whitespace-only Files**
- Tests patch application to completely empty files
- Tests files containing only whitespace characters
- Ensures proper handling of edge cases in content detection

### 3. Matching Algorithm Edge Cases (`TestMatchingEdgeCases`)

**Multiple Identical Matches**
- Tests scenarios where search content appears multiple times
- Ensures only the first occurrence is replaced (predictable behavior)
- Verifies proper match disambiguation

**Overlapping Matches**
- Tests patterns where search content could match overlapping regions
- Ensures deterministic matching behavior
- Verifies proper boundary handling

**Regex Special Characters**
- Tests search content containing regex metacharacters:
  - Character classes (`[a-z]+`)
  - Quantifiers (`\\d*`)
  - Anchors (`^`, `$`)
  - Special symbols (`$`, `+`, `*`)
- Ensures literal string matching (not regex interpretation)
- Verifies proper escaping of special characters

**Fuzzy Matching Thresholds**
- Tests exact threshold boundaries (70% similarity)
- Ensures predictable behavior at similarity boundaries
- Verifies proper fallback when similarity is too low

**Indentation Preservation**
- Tests mixed tab and space indentation
- Ensures original indentation patterns are preserved
- Verifies proper handling of complex indentation scenarios

### 4. Concurrency Edge Cases (`TestConcurrencyEdgeCases`)

**Concurrent Patch Applications**
- Tests applying multiple patches simultaneously to different files
- Ensures thread safety and proper resource management
- Verifies no race conditions or data corruption

**File Modification During Operation**
- Tests scenarios where files are modified while patches are being applied
- Ensures graceful handling of concurrent file system operations
- Verifies proper error handling for conflicting operations

**Workspace Operations During Patching**
- Tests performing other workspace operations while patches are applied
- Ensures proper isolation between different operation types
- Verifies system stability under concurrent operations

### 5. Error Recovery Edge Cases (`TestErrorRecoveryEdgeCases`)

**Partial Failure Scenarios**
- Tests multi-file patches where some files succeed and others fail
- Ensures proper partial success reporting
- Verifies rollback or continuation behavior as appropriate

**Corrupted Workspace**
- Tests patch application to corrupted or missing workspaces
- Ensures graceful error handling for workspace integrity issues
- Verifies proper error reporting and recovery

**Memory Pressure**
- Tests patch application under simulated memory pressure
- Ensures system stability with very large content processing
- Verifies graceful degradation under resource constraints

**Operation Interruption**
- Tests behavior when patch operations are interrupted
- Ensures proper cleanup and error handling
- Verifies system consistency after interruption

### 6. Advanced Edge Cases (`TestAdvancedEdgeCases`)

**Circular Replacement Patterns**
- Tests patches that could create circular replacement scenarios
- Ensures proper handling of potentially infinite loops
- Verifies deterministic behavior in complex replacement chains

**Nested Search/Replace Markers**
- Tests content containing search/replace markers as literal text
- Ensures proper parsing and handling of nested markers
- Verifies correct distinction between syntax and content

**Very Deep Code Nesting**
- Tests patch application to deeply nested code structures (10+ levels)
- Ensures proper handling of complex indentation patterns
- Verifies performance with deeply nested content

**Boundary Condition Matches**
- Tests search content at file boundaries (start, end, entire file)
- Ensures proper handling of edge positions
- Verifies correct content replacement at boundaries

**Fuzzy Matching Edge Cases**
- Tests exact threshold matching scenarios
- Ensures predictable behavior at similarity boundaries
- Verifies proper space normalization handling

## Performance Considerations

The test suite includes several performance-related edge cases:

- **Large File Handling**: Tests with 10MB+ content
- **Long Line Processing**: Tests with 100,000+ character lines
- **Deep Nesting**: Tests with 10+ levels of nested structures
- **Concurrent Operations**: Tests with multiple simultaneous operations
- **Memory Usage**: Tests under simulated memory pressure

## Security Considerations

Several security-related edge cases are covered:

- **Path Traversal Prevention**: Tests against `../../../etc/passwd` type attacks
- **Null Byte Injection**: Tests against null byte filename attacks
- **Workspace Sandboxing**: Ensures operations stay within workspace boundaries
- **Permission Handling**: Tests proper handling of file permissions

## Error Handling Patterns

The test suite verifies several error handling patterns:

- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating despite individual failures
- **Proper Error Reporting**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Rollback Behavior**: Appropriate handling of partial failures
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of resources after errors
